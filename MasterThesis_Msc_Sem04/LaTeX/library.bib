Clin. Neurophysiol. 70 510). Four linear methods: Pearson's correlation method (PCM), Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD), stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) and a linear support vector machine (LSVM); and one nonlinear method: Gaussian kernel support vector machine (GSVM), are compared for classifying offline data from eight users. The relative performance of the classifiers is evaluated, along with the practical concerns regarding the implementation of the respective methods. The results indicate that while all methods attained acceptable performance levels, SWLDA and FLD provide the best overall performance and implementation characteristics for practical classification of P300 Speller data.}

    abstract = {<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are tools for controlling computers and other devices without using muscular activity, employing user-controlled variations in signals recorded from the user’s brain. One of the most efficient noninvasive BCIs is based on the P300 wave of the brain’s response to stimuli and is therefore referred to as the P300 BCI. Many modifications of this BCI have been proposed to further improve the BCI’s characteristics or to better adapt the BCI to various applications. However, in the original P300 BCI and in all of its modifications, the spatial positions of stimuli were fixed relative to each other, which can impose constraints on designing applications controlled by this BCI. We designed and tested a P300 BCI with stimuli presented on objects that were freely moving on a screen at a speed of 5.4°/s. Healthy participants practiced a game-like task with this BCI in either single-trial or triple-trial mode within four sessions. At each step, the participants were required to select one of nine moving objects. The mean online accuracy of BCI-based selection was 81% in the triple-trial mode and 65% in the single-trial mode. A relatively high P300 amplitude was observed in response to targets in most participants. Self-rated interest in the task was high and stable over the four sessions (the medians in the 1st/4th sessions were 79/84% and 76/71% in the groups practicing in the single-trial and triple-trial modes, respectively). We conclude that the movement of stimulus positions relative to each other may not prevent the efficient use of the P300 BCI by people controlling their gaze, e.g., in robotic devices and in video games. </p>},

Three subjects were asked to mentally drive the wheelchair to 3 target locations using 3 mental commands. These mental commands were respectively associated with the three wheelchair steering behaviors: \emph{turn left}, \emph{turn right}, and \emph{move forward}. The subjects participated in 30 randomized trials (10 trials per target). The performance was assessed in terms of percentage of reached targets calculated in function of the distance between the final wheelchair position and the target at each trial. To assess the brain-actuated control achieved by the subjects, their performances were compared with the performance achieved by a random BCI. The subjects drove the wheelchair closer than 1 meter from the target in 20\\%, 37\\%, and 7\\% of the trials, and closer than 2 meters in 37\\%, 53\\%, and 27\\% of the trials, respectively. The random BCI drove it closer than 1 and 2 meters in 0\\% and 13\\% of the trials, respectively. The results show that the subjects could achieve a significant level of mental control, even if far from optimal, to drive an intelligent wheelchair, thus demonstrating the feasibility of continuously controlling complex robotics devices using an asynchronous and non-invasive BCI.},
